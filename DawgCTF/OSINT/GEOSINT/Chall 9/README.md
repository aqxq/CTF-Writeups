## Solution

Quick Google reverse image search on a screenshot of this beautiful view gives me a website that has a picture of the same place, which we can confirm by comparing the compass rose on the floor.

Going to the website, the picture can be found under the heading of "`Mt. Hakodate`". This tells us the location. Looking further, it is the `Mt. Hakodate Observatory`.
