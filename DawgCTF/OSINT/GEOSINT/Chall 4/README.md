## Solution
Looking around, a bunch of buildings can be seen. A quick Google reverse image search of the buildings show that this is somewhere in `Panama City, Panama`

Before I start using Google Maps, I look around, and notice that the road I am currently on seems to be curving around, taking the shape of an `upside down 'u'`. This will be vital information when I am finding my precise location. 

On Google Maps, I find one road above water that is shaped like an upside down 'u'.

Looking around again, I seem to be on the left side of the Cinta Costera.
