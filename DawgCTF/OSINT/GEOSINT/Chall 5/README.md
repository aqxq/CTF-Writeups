## Solution

* Side note: I've actually been here before and that allowed me to solve this without doing any research lol

Looking around, there is `FOLLOW OUR JOURNEY` on the window. Taking a screenshot and reverse image searching it gives a University of Maryland page that shows the link under the text much more clearly.

The link is `sanctuary.aqua.org`. Opening this link allows you to infer that this picture was taken at the National Aquarium in Baltimore.
