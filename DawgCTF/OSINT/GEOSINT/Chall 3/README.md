## Chall 3

## Solution
Upon opening the Geosint, you see a `Bank Of Malidves` and a `Pizza Hut` right next to each other. 

A quick Google Maps search for `pizza hut next to bank of maldives` gives 3 results. The street view for the Pizza Hut at `Ameenee Magu Male Square - Gaakoshi Ground Floor, Maldives` matches with the street view for the Geosint, so we have our location.
