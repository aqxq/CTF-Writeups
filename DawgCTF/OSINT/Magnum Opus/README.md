## Magnum Opus

I was watching a chess game, and was wowed extremely with the positional thinking I saw from white. I had to step away, unfortunately.... that was a long time ago, and I still want to see how the game developed. Given the first few moves which I wrote down, can you find out what this game was called?

## Solution

The PGN provided in the challenge contains the following moves:

```c
1. e4 d6
2. d4 f6 (2... Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3 Bg7 5. Qd2 c6 6. f3 b5 7. Nge2 Nbd7
8. Bh6 Bxh6 9. Qxh6 Bb7 10. a3 e5 11. O-O-O Qe7 12. Kb1 a6 13. Nc1 O-O-O 14. Nb3
exd4) *
```

The moves 1. e4 d6 2. d4 suggest the start of a Pirc Defense. This is a famous game between Garry Kasparov (White) and Veselin Topalov (Black) played in the 1999 Wijk aan Zee tournament, which is often referred to as Kasparov's Immortal.
