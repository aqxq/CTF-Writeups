## Cantor's Pairadox

Now that I have encrypted my flag with a new math function I was just researching I can know share it with my friend Cantor and no one will know how to read it except us!

## Solution

A [script](https://github.com/aqxq/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/DawgCTF/Crypto/Cantor's%20Pairadox/script.py) can be made to solve this challenge.

FLAG: `Dawg{1_pr3f3r_4ppl3s_t0_pa1rs_4nyw2y5}`
