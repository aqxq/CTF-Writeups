## Mystery Signal I

I was listening to my scanner when I heard a strange signal. Can you decode it?

## Solution

Taking a listen to the audio, it sounds like morse code. I chose to use this [morse code audio to text transcriber](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).


FLAG: `LISTENCAREFULLY`
