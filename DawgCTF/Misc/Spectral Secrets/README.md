## Spectral Secrets

I was downloading some music from Limewire and came across a strange file. Can you help me figure out what it is?

## Solution

The word "Spectral" in the challenge name hints at a spectrum. Opening the audio file in Audacity, which has built-in spectral analysis tools, you are able to open up a spectrogram and the flag is visible.
